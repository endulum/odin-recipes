    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There is nothing about even the mere mention of this dish that doesn't spark instant joy. Cheesy, beefy, beany goodness with a rainbow of toppings decorating the meal like it's Christmas is an image that sounds too good to be true. Thank goodness it's true!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the Base</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Onion.</b> You may want to use the whole onion. Should be diced.</li>
        <li><b>Ground beef.</b></li>
        <li><b>A can of beans.</b> Pinto, ranch style, or chili works for this dish. Should be washed and ready to cook.</li>
        <li><b>Shredded cheese.</b> The more cheese, the merrier! Cheese type is up to you but I suggest Cheddar and Monterey Jack for their classic good flavor.</li>
        <li><b>Tortilla chips.</b></li>
        <li><b>Salt, pepper, chili powder, paprika, cumin, crushed red pepper.</b> While salt and pepper are not optional, the rest is up to you and your desired flavor.</li>
        <li><b>Cooking oil.</b> At your reference, though I suggest olive oil.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Toppings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>2 - 4 whole Roma tomatoes.</b> Amount is up to you. Should be diced.</li>
        <li><b>Fistful of cilantro</b> Should be chopped.</li>
        <li><b>A whole jalapeno.</b></li>
        <li><b>Juice of one lime.</b></li>
        <li><b>A whole avocado.</b> Should be diced.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>The following assumes you have diced the onions, tomato, and cilantro, and washed your beans.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Reserve half of the diced onion for cooking with the beef and the other half for adding to the toppings. Throw half of the diced onion and 2 tablespoons of cooking oil into a skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Once the onion is softening, add the ground beef.</li>
        <li>Once the beef has fully browned, add the salt, pepper, cumin paprika, chili powder, and crushed red pepper. Add the beans and a little bit of water. Let the beef simmer on low heat.</li>
        <li>While the beef simmers, prepare the topping. Combine and stir together the rest of the onion, tomato, cilantro, jalapeno, and lime juice, with a dash of salt. You can add the avocade early here.</li>
        <li>Retrieve a large dish that you will bake the nachos in. It should be microwave-safe, but if not, you can use the oven. Once the beef and beans is done, prepare "layers" of each component into the dish. A layer of chips, then a layer of beef and beans, then a layer of shredded cheese. Repeat this sequence until you've ran out.</li>
        <li>Either microwave or oven-bake the dish until the cheese has been fully melted.</li>
        <li>Add the topping mixture and avocados. Serve and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
