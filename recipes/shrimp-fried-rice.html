    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Rice has few opponents when in competition for the most versatile, filling, scrumptious food. It's been used in all kinds of different dishes, all in which it stands out as a staple, a crucial ingredient. This success story is no different in this dish.</p>
    <p>Shrimp fried rice somewhat speaks for itself. It's rice, not fried by a shrimp of course, but with shrimp as part of the dish. An unassuming descriptor, but the taste will write so much more onto your tongue.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Multiply serving amounts by however many servings you want to cook at once.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Rice.</b> One serving needs about 1 and 1 quarter of a cup of uncooked rice. Cook it before beginning with this dish.</li>
        <li><b>Cooking oil.</b> At your preference, but I suggest olive oil.</li>
        <li><b>Onion.</b> One serving needs about 1 quarter cup of chopped onion.</li>
        <li><b>Garlic.</b> One serving needs about 1 and 1 half of a clove of finely chopped garlic.</li>
        <li><b>Eggs.</b> One serving usually needs 1 egg.</li>
        <li><b>Shrimp.</b> Must be fresh, cleaned, and ready to cook. One serving usually needs 1 cup of shrimp.</li>
        <li><b>Veggie blend.</b> The actual combination of vegetables is up to you, but my favorite choices are: peas, carrots, corn, green beans. One serving needs about 1 cup of total veggies.</li>
        <li><b>Soy sauce.</b></li>
        <li><b>Salt and pepper.</b></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>The following assumes you have already cooked the rice and chopped the onions and garlic.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons of cooking oil to a skillet on medium heat.</li>
        <li>Once the skillet is emanating heat, add your shrimp, and cook for about 3 minutes, tossing individually to cook thoroughly on all sides.</li>
        <li>Once shrimp are done, remove the shrimp, but leave the oil in the skillet. If there isn't much oil, feel free to add more.</li>
        <li>Crack eggs over skillet and quickly beat with your spoon until clumps start forming. Once clumps have somewhat solidified, scoop all egg out and set aside in its own dish.</li>
        <li>Again, add more oil to your liking if the remaining oil is too scarce. Throw in your onions and garlic. Turn the heat to medium and let the onions and garlic sizzle for a couple minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn down the heat a little bit again and throw in your veggie blend. Add salt and pepper. Stir the skillet's contents occasionally.</li>
        <li>Once the veggies are cooked thoroughly and tender enough to your liking, add your rice, shrimp, and egg.</li>
        <li>Add soy sauce to your liking.</li>
        <li>Mix everything together over the next five minutes or so. Serve and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
